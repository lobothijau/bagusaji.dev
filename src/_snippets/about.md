<p class="lead">I help clients confidently launch Android & iOS apps in the App Store with their technology of choice.</p>

My programming journey started in 2012 when I was a freshman in Computer Science Education at [Indonesia University of Education](https://upi.edu/). I was taking Algorithm I with the C Programming Language. Coming from a background of vocatinal high school with some basic computing skills, learing to program was an interesting experience for me. 

Fast forward to 2017, due to my skills in writing programming I was invited to join the company of my senior as an Editor. Here I work for about a year before transitioning to a trainer. 

## Codepolitan

Codepolitan was my very first company I join before graduation ceremoy. Here I work with multiple roles and my first role was writer plus editor. 

I started by journey in 2012 at Pivotal Labs where I learned Ruby on Rails, test-driven development, and pair programming.

After Labs I worked for a startup for 5 years as the lead developer. I built the iOS and Android apps with Turbo Native and advice from the team at Basecamp. Back when it was still called Turbolinks!

At the beginning of 2020 I decided to stake out on my own and went independent. Since then I've worked on a bunch of side projects and launched dozens of apps in the App Store.

Now I'm focused on spreading Turbo Native and teaching developers what it takes to be a solopreneur. I'm sharing my journey as the solo-founder of transparent businesses like [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com), the _reverse_ job board for Ruby on Rails developers.
