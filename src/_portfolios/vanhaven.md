Developed the frontend for VanHaven's 3D Van Configurator, an interactive web application that enables custom van design and ordering. Built with vanilla JavaScript to deliver a seamless configuration experience integrated with Threedium's 3D rendering service.

Technical Implementation:
- Architected a modular JavaScript application handling complex product configurations including interior layouts, exterior modifications, body colors, and electrical/heating systems
- Engineered custom UI components without frameworks, including color pickers and feature selectors, demonstrating strong vanilla JavaScript expertise
- Implemented seamless integration with Threedium's 3D engine service (Three.js behind the scene), managing state synchronization between UI controls and 3D model updates
- Built responsive and intuitive interface components using pure CSS, ensuring consistent experience across devices
- Developed robust event handling system to manage complex state changes across multiple customization categories
