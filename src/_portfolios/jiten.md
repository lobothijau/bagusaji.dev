Jiten is a Japanese-Indonesian dictionary developed with Kotlin for Android devices. It uses SQLite full-text search capability through Android's Room library. 

Database used by the app is the JMDict, an open source japanese dictionary which uses English entries. Since it's in English there's an effort to translate English words into Bahasa Indonesia and the app now only have less than 10% entries translated.

There's no "official translator" to help with the translation, hence it's progressing really slow.
