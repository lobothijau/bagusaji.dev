VanHaven 3D Configurator is a web based app built to let user order custom transporter van. User could pick any feature they want to add, any color they want to have with a slick and user friendly menus. I build the frontend side of this site using vanilla **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** while my friend build the 3D model.

The project is completed and online, but the main site is not completed yet (developed by other vendor). Visit the completed website [here](http://configurator.vanhaven.co.uk).
