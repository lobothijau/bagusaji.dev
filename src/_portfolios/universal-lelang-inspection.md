Unicersal Collection (UC) is an automotive auction house similar to what [JBA Indonesia's doing](/portfolios/jba-indonesia/). But, the app I built was an app used by the auction house to inspect vehicles before they appeared on the auction. This app was built with Kotlin at [Logique](https://logique.co.id){:target="_blank"}.

## Technologies

Feature-wise, this app is fairly simple because it only do one thing and doing it very well. As a native Kotlin-based Android app it uses Retrofit for networking, Room for local database, leverage release flavoring (DEV, STAING, PRODUCTION) for development and QA.

The app distributed internally between the employee of the auction house, so there's no Play Store link to share.
