[Dokodemo-Kerja](https://dokodemo-kerja.com/) is an attendance management app helping companies manage their employee's remote work record with a desktop and mobile app. The mobile version built with **React Native** for multi-platform release. My colleague built the original app and I taking over maintenance work to fix bugs and adding new feature such as location-aware start session.

Dokodemo-Kerja available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dokodemomobile&hl=uz&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/id/app/dokodemo-kerja/id1506859201), but you need a subscription license.


## Technologies

The app uses [Background Geolocation for React Native](https://github.com/transistorsoft/react-native-background-geolocation), a sophisticated background location-tracking & geofencing module for React Native. With the help of [React Native Background Fetch](https://github.com/transistorsoft/react-native-background-fetch) the app can work when the app is in the background. 

For it's state management, Dokodemo-Kerja uses Redux.
